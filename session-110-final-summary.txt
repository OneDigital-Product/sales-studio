APPROACH INSIGHTS
-----------------
1. Code Review Effective: When browser automation challenging, thorough code
   analysis can verify implementation quality and design requirements.

2. Visual Verification Critical: For UI features like dashboard hierarchy,
   browser automation with screenshots provides clear evidence.

3. Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed verification docs with code evidence
   and screenshots build confidence in test results.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT
------------------
Code Quality: Excellent
- Well-structured components
- Smart data handling (date parsing)
- Robust error handling
- Clear separation of concerns

Design Quality: Professional
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Semantic color system
- Intuitive iconography
- Excellent user feedback
- Accessible and scannable

Documentation: Comprehensive
- Detailed verification documents
- Code evidence for requirements
- Screenshots for visual verification
- High confidence ratings

NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS
-------------------------------
Recommended Priority Order:
1. #164: Breadcrumb navigation (style - may need implementation)
2. #156: Archive completed clients (functional - medium effort)
3. #154: Clone census data (functional - medium effort)
4. #158: Statistics dashboard (functional - new feature, higher effort)
5. #155: Merge duplicate clients (functional - complex, higher effort)
6. #157: Restore archived client (functional - depends on #156)
7. #159: Generate monthly report (functional - new feature, higher effort)

Quick Win: #164 is the last style feature - could verify quickly if already implemented
