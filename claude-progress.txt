✅ 3. DISCOVERED AND FIXED FILE UPLOAD BUG

   Issue Found:
   - handleUpload function signature was React.FormEvent
   - But called from onChange event (React.ChangeEvent)
   - This type mismatch prevented file uploads from working

   Fix Applied (app/clients/[id]/page.tsx):
   - Changed: handleUpload(e: React.FormEvent)
   - To: handleUpload(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)
   - Removed: e.preventDefault() (not needed for onChange)
   - Changed: Access files via e.target.files instead of getElementById
   - Changed: Clear input via e.target.value = ""

   Lines Modified: 151-169

✅ 4. TESTED FILE UPLOAD (Feature #4)
   - Created test file programmatically via JavaScript
   - Uploaded "test-insurance-proposal.txt" successfully

- after-programmatic-upload.png
- files-with-new-uploads.png
- file-list-complete.png

===============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
===============================================================================

Bug Fix Details:
The file upload was broken because the handleUpload function expected a FormEvent
but was bound to the file input's onChange event (which emits ChangeEvent). This
caused the upload logic to not execute properly when files were selected.

The fix changes the function signature to match the actual event type and accesses
files directly from e.target instead of querying the DOM. This is more React-idiomatic
and works correctly with the onChange event.

Drag-and-Drop Implementation:
The drag-and-drop handlers (handleDragOver, handleDragEnter, handleDragLeave, handleDrop)
are already implemented and look correct. The handleDrop function properly processes
dropped files and calls uploadSingleFile for each one. This feature likely works
but cannot be fully tested via browser automation due to security restrictions.

File Type Detection:
The isCensusFile function checks:
1. File extension matches .xlsx, .xls, or .csv
2. Parses file with xlsx library
3. Checks if headers contain at least 2 census keywords (DOB, gender, salary, zip, etc.)
This heuristic approach works well for distinguishing census files from other documents.

===============================================================================
TESTING OBSERVATIONS
===============================================================================

What Works Well:
- Real-time file list updates via Convex subscriptions
- Pre-signed URLs for secure file downloads
- Automatic file type detection (census vs. other)

- Upload progress indicator ("Uploading & Analyzing...")
- Multi-file support built into upload handler

Verified Functionality:
- Single file upload ✅

Session Date: 2024-12-09
===============================================================================

MISSION: Verify quote status and census validation features through code review
        and browser testing where possible

===============================================================================
ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
===============================================================================

CURRENT STATUS: 14 features passing (8.3%)
- 14 features verified as working
- 155 features remaining to test
- Multiple features implemented but difficult to test via browser automation

===============================================================================
CODE REVIEW FINDINGS
===============================================================================

✅ QUOTE STATUS SYSTEM - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Backend (convex/quotes.ts):
- getQuotesByClient: Query quotes for a client ✅
- updateQuoteStatus: Create or update quote status ✅
- getQuoteHistory: Retrieve status change history ✅
- getQuotesDashboard: Dashboard summary view ✅
- Automatic history tracking on status changes ✅
- Support for PEO and ACA quote types ✅
- Status options: not_started, intake, underwriting, proposal_ready, presented, accepted, declined ✅
- Blocked status with reason tracking ✅
- Terminal status handling (accepted/declined) ✅

Frontend Components:
- QuoteStatusCard (components/quotes/quote-status-card.tsx):
  * Displays quote status with visual indicators ✅
  * Progress bar showing pipeline stage ✅
  * Status badges with color coding ✅
  * Blocked status display with reason ✅
  * Status notes display ✅
  * History expandable section ✅
  * Started/completed timestamps ✅

- QuoteStatusUpdate (components/quotes/quote-status-update.tsx):
  * Dropdown menu for status selection ✅
  * Dialog for status change with notes ✅
  * Block quote functionality ✅
  * Validation (requires block reason when blocking) ✅
  * Real-time updates via Convex mutation ✅

Visual Verification:
- Saw quote status cards on Test Client page:
  * PEO Quote: "Underwriting" status with progress bar
  * ACA Quote: "Intake" status with progress bar
  * Update Status dropdown buttons visible
  * Notes displayed ("Starting underwriting review process...")
  * History section shown ("History (1)")

LIMITATION: Radix UI dropdown menus cannot be reliably triggered via
JavaScript automation, preventing full end-to-end testing of status updates.
However, all code is implemented and UI elements are rendering correctly.

✅ CENSUS VALIDATION SYSTEM - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Backend (convex/censusValidation.ts):
- validateCensus: Manual validation trigger ✅
- runValidation: Internal validation (auto-called after import) ✅
- getValidation: Query validation results ✅
- Field requirements defined for PEO and ACA ✅
- Validators: date, zip, salary, hours per week, non-empty ✅
- Column alias matching (e.g., "DOB" → "date_of_birth") ✅
- Issue detection: missing_column, missing_value, invalid_value ✅
- PEO and ACA score calculation (0-100) ✅
- Row-level issue tracking ✅

Auto-Trigger Implementation:
- Census import (convex/census.ts line 43):
  ```typescript
  await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.censusValidation.runValidation, {
    censusUploadId,
  });
  ```
- Validation runs automatically after every census import ✅

Frontend Component (components/census/census-viewer.tsx):
- Fetches validation data via useQuery ✅
- Displays validation summary when issues exist ✅
- Shows PEO and ACA scores with color coding ✅
- Lists all issues grouped by type ✅
- Row filtering: all/valid/issues only ✅
- Cell highlighting for problematic data ✅

- "Request Missing Info" mailto link generation ✅

Visual Verification:
- Saw census viewer displaying census data
- Green checkmarks (✓) visible next to row numbers
- "All Rows" filter dropdown present (3 rows)
- No validation summary box visible (current census is 100% valid)

Field Requirements Implemented:
- employee_name: Required for PEO + ACA ✅
- date_of_birth: Required for PEO + ACA, date validation ✅
- zip_code: Required for PEO + ACA, 5-digit format ✅
- salary: Required for PEO + ACA, positive number ✅
- coverage_tier: Required for PEO + ACA ✅
- hours_per_week: Required for ACA only, 0-168 range ✅
- hire_date: Required for ACA only, date validation ✅

===============================================================================
BROWSER AUTOMATION CHALLENGES
===============================================================================

ISSUE: Radix UI Dropdown Menus
- Component: DropdownMenu from @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
- Problem: JavaScript click() events don't trigger dropdown portal rendering
- Attempted solutions:
  * Direct button.click()
  * MouseEvent dispatching (mousedown, mouseup, click)
  * Multiple timing variations
  * Different selector strategies
- Result: Dropdown content never appears in DOM
- Impact: Cannot test quote status updates, filter dropdowns via automation

WORKAROUND APPLIED:
- Verified implementation through code review
- Confirmed UI elements render correctly
- Validated backend functions exist and are properly wired
- Checked database schema supports all required fields
- Reviewed real-time update mechanisms

Note: Features #16-26 are IMPLEMENTED but cannot be marked as "passing" in
feature_list.json without successful end-to-end browser testing per project
requirements.

===============================================================================
TECHNICAL DEBT & RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================================================================

1. DROPDOWN TESTING LIMITATION
   - Current approach: Browser automation with Puppeteer
   - Issue: Radix UI dropdowns incompatible with programmatic triggers
   - Recommendation: Consider Playwright or Cypress for better component support
   - Alternative: Manual QA testing for dropdown interactions

2. VALIDATION SUMMARY NOT VISIBLE
   - Reason: Current census (census-with-birthdate-alias.csv) is 100% valid
   - Need: Upload census with intentional issues to verify summary UI
   - Test file exists: test-census-missing-column.csv (missing salary)
   - Blocked by: File upload automation triggering census detection inconsistently

3. QUOTE CREATION BUTTONS
   - Observed: "PEO Quoting" and "Perfect Quote" buttons are disabled
   - Location: Client detail page header
   - Impact: Cannot create new quotes (but quotes already exist in database)
   - Recommendation: Implement quote creation workflow

===============================================================================
NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
===============================================================================

PRIORITY 1 - WORK AROUND AUTOMATION LIMITS:
1. Focus on features testable without dropdowns
2. Mark implemented features as "verified via code review" in notes
3. Test features with direct API/mutation calls where possible

PRIORITY 2 - ALTERNATIVE TESTING APPROACH:
1. Create test script that directly calls Convex mutations
2. Verify database state changes
3. Screenshot UI after mutations to verify rendering

PRIORITY 3 - REMAINING TESTABLE FEATURES:
1. Feature #15: Census column alias detection (already works, saw "birthdate")
2. UI/visual features that don't require interaction
3. Data display features

===============================================================================
