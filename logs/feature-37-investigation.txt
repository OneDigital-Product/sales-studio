Feature #37: Filter census view by validation status

INVESTIGATION:
- Code exists in census-viewer.tsx (lines 283-303)
- Filter button renders with correct text "All Rows"
- Button has aria-expanded="false"
- Dropdown content does not appear in DOM when clicked
- No menu items found with role="menuitem"
- No Radix UI popper content found

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
1. Dropdown component not rendering (React issue)
2. Event handler not attached (hydration issue)
3. CSS z-index or visibility issue
4. Portal rendering outside viewport

NEXT STEPS:
- Try navigating to a different client with census data
- Check if issue is specific to this test client
- Examine dropdown component imports
