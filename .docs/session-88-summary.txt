COMPLETED FEATURE
===============================================================================

Feature: Census viewer table design (style test) ✅

Implementation:
1. Enhanced Table Component (components/ui/table.tsx):
   - TableHead: Added sticky positioning
     * sticky top-0 z-10 - Headers stay visible when scrolling
     * bg-background - Solid background to cover content beneath
   - TableHeader: Enhanced visual separation
     * border-b-2 - Thicker border under header row
   - TableRow: Implemented zebra striping
     * [&:nth-child(even)>td]:bg-muted/50 - Even rows have gray background
     * Applied to <td> elements (not <tr>) for browser compatibility
     * hover:[&>td]:bg-muted/70 - Enhanced hover state
   - Existing features maintained:
     * Cell padding: p-2 (comfortable spacing)
     * Validation highlighting: bg-red-50, bg-yellow-50 (already working)

2. Technical Challenges Resolved:
   - Issue: Zebra striping not working with even:bg-color or [&:nth-child(even)]:bg-color
   - Root cause: Background on <tr> elements doesn't render consistently across browsers
   - Solution: Target <td> elements with [&:nth-child(even)>td]:bg-muted/50
   - Testing: Used bg-blue-100 temporarily to confirm selector was working
   - Final: Settled on bg-muted/50 for subtle, professional appearance

3. Browser Verification Steps:
   - Navigated to Feature 116 Workflow Test client
   - Scrolled to Census Data section (test-census-valid.csv)
   - Verified sticky headers work (headers stay visible in viewport)
   - Verified zebra striping visible on even rows (rows 2, 4 have gray background)
   - Verified cell padding is comfortable (existing p-2 spacing)
   - Verified validation indicators clear (green checkmarks visible)
   - Screenshots: census-table-final

Test Requirements Met:
✅ Table headers are sticky - Headers remain visible when scrolling
✅ Row striping improves readability - Even rows have subtle gray background
✅ Cell padding is comfortable - p-2 provides good spacing
✅ Highlighted cells stand out clearly - Validation colors work well

Files Modified:
- components/ui/table.tsx (enhanced TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow)
- feature_list.json (marked test as passing)
