SESSION 80 SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: 2025-12-10
Duration: ~1 session
Tests Completed: 1 (Feature #119)
Tests Now Passing: 120/169 (71.0%)

FEATURE COMPLETED
================================================================================
✅ Feature #119: Validate census with all ACA required fields present

Implementation Approach:
- Discovered ACA validation logic was already implemented in convex/censusValidation.ts
- Created comprehensive test script (test-f119-aca-validation.mjs)
- Verified functionality through both backend script and browser automation

Test Coverage:
1. Created test client programmatically
2. Imported census with all 7 required fields (PEO + ACA fields)
3. Verified automatic validation triggered
4. Confirmed ACA score: 100%
5. Confirmed PEO score: 100%
6. Verified no validation issues reported
7. Tested through UI with browser automation

ACA Required Fields Validated:
- employee_name ✓
- date_of_birth ✓
- zip_code ✓
- salary ✓
- coverage_tier ✓
- hours_per_week ✓ (ACA-specific, 0-168 range validation)
- hire_date ✓ (ACA-specific, date format validation)

Key Learnings:
- Census rows must be passed as array of objects (not array of arrays)
- Each row object uses column names as keys
- Validation automatically runs after census import
- Need 2-second delay for validation to complete

Files Created/Modified:
- test-f119-aca-validation.mjs (new test script)
- feature_list.json (marked test #119 as passing)
- claude-progress.txt (session notes)
