OBJECTIVE:
Implement Feature #110: View validation error tooltip on hover

STARTING STATE:
- 110 features passing (65.1%)

- Error messages were available via title attribute (browser default tooltip)
- Need proper tooltip component for better UX

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Installed Tooltip Dependencies:
   - Added @radix-ui/react-tooltip via npm
   - Package provides accessible, customizable tooltip primitives

2. Created Tooltip Component (components/ui/tooltip.tsx):
   - Shadcn-style wrapper around Radix UI primitives
   - Exports: TooltipProvider, Tooltip, TooltipTrigger, TooltipContent
   - Styled with border, shadow, fade-in animation
   - Consistent with other UI components in the app

3. Updated Census Viewer (components/census/census-viewer.tsx):
   - Imported Tooltip components
   - Wrapped entire component with TooltipProvider
   - Modified cell rendering to conditionally wrap error cells with Tooltip
   - Added cursor-help class to tooltip triggers
   - Set delayDuration to 200ms for responsive feel
