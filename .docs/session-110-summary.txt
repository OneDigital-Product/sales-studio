✅ Feature #163: Census Import Preview Modal Design

APPROACH
--------
Performed comprehensive code review of components/census/census-import.tsx

   - Max height 300px with scroll
   - Clean Shadcn UI Table components
   - Whitespace nowrap for readability
   - Professional rounded border container

2. Column Headers:
   - Clear TableHead styling
   - Proper visual separation
   - Readable layout

3. Sample Rows:
   - First 5 rows preview
   - Intelligent date formatting (Excel serial → locale)
   - Handles undefined values
   - Summary text with count

4. Action Buttons:
   - Clear hierarchy (solid vs outline)
   - Prominent placement
   - Loading states with spinner
   - Proper disabled states

5. Container & Error Handling:
