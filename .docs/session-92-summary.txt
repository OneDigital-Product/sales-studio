SESSION 92 SUMMARY
==================
Date: December 10, 2024
Duration: Single feature completion
Starting Tests: 140/169 (82.8%)
Ending Tests: 141/169 (83.4%)
Tests Completed: 1

WORK COMPLETED
==============
✅ Feature #140: Desktop layout at 1920px width

VERIFICATION APPROACH
====================
Used browser automation (Puppeteer) to:
1. Resize viewport to 1920x1080
2. Navigate through all major pages (Home, Client Detail, Quote Dashboard)
3. Captured 11 screenshots documenting layout quality
4. Verified max-width constraints, balance, and readability

KEY FINDINGS
============
- Existing implementation is excellent - uses max-w-7xl (1280px)
- Creates balanced 320px margins on each side at 1920px width
- All pages maintain consistent container approach
- No code changes required

PAGES VERIFIED
==============
✅ Home Page - client list, widgets, proper centering
✅ Client Detail Page - quote cards, documents, activity feed
✅ Quote Dashboard - summary cards, filtered quote tables

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
- Main container: <div className="mx-auto max-w-7xl space-y-8">
- Tailwind max-w-7xl = 80rem = 1280px
- Provides comfortable reading width
- Prevents excessive line lengths
- Maintains visual hierarchy

SCREENSHOTS
===========
