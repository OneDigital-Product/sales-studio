Feature #144: Success notifications are clear ✅

Created a comprehensive, production-quality toast notification system that provides
clear, user-friendly success feedback for all major actions in the application.

Toast Notification System Implementation:
- NEW COMPONENT: components/ui/toast.tsx
- React Context + Provider pattern for global toast state
- Custom hook: useToast() for easy access anywhere in app
- TypeScript with full type safety
- Zero external dependencies

Features:
- 4 toast variants: success, error, warning, info
- Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds (configurable)
- Manual dismiss with X button
- Fixed top-right positioning (z-index 50)
- Smooth animations: slide-in-from-top-5 + fade-in
- Multiple toast stacking with gap-2 spacing

Success Variant Specifications:
✅ Green color scheme: bg-green-50, border-green-200, text-green-800
✅ CheckCircle2 icon from Lucide (green-600, 20x20px)
✅ Shadow-lg for elevation (visible but not obtrusive)
✅ Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds (industry standard)

Success Notifications Added To:
- File uploads: "Successfully uploaded X file(s)"
- File deletion: "File deleted successfully"
- Client updates: "Client information updated successfully"
- Client deletion: "Client deleted successfully"
- Bookmarks: "Client bookmarked" / "Bookmark removed"
- Census import: "Census data imported successfully"
- Quote creation: "PEO/ACA quote created successfully"
- Quote updates: "PEO/ACA quote status updated to [Status]"
- Quote blocking: "PEO/ACA quote marked as blocked"
