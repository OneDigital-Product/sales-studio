FEATURE COMPLETED: #143 - Error Messages Are Visually Distinct
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements Met:
✅ Error messages use red color
✅ Error icon is present
✅ Message text is clear
✅ Error doesn't blend into background

Implementation Highlights:
--------------------------

1. NEW COMPONENT: Alert Component (components/ui/alert.tsx)
   - Reusable component with 4 variants: error, warning, success, info
   - Error variant styling:
     * bg-red-50 (light red background)
     * border-red-200 (distinct border)
     * text-red-700/800/900 (high contrast text)
     * XCircle icon, text-red-600, 20x20px
   - Type-safe TypeScript implementation
   - Flexible layout with optional title
   - Consistent with Shadcn UI patterns

2. UPDATED: Census Import (components/census/census-import.tsx)
   - Replaced custom error div with Alert component
   - Added XCircle icon (was missing)
   - Improved maintainability and consistency
   - Error triggers: corrupted files, empty files, parsing failures

3. VERIFIED: File Upload Dialog (components/files/file-upload-dialog.tsx)
   - Already had excellent error styling
   - No changes needed
   - Red color scheme, error icon, clear messaging

Design Benefits:
----------------
- High contrast for readability
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Distinct from background (doesn't blend)
- Professional and user-friendly
- Maintainable (single source of truth)
- Accessible (semantic HTML, good contrast)
