VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY
===============================================================================

All features verified through browser automation:
1. Navigated to application pages at specified viewport sizes
2. Captured screenshots of all major sections
3. Verified visual appearance and layout quality
4. Checked for horizontal scroll, spacing, and readability
5. Confirmed touch targets and interactive elements

No code changes required - existing implementation already meets all
responsive design requirements at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
