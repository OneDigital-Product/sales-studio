SESSION 48 SUMMARY - FEATURE #80: TIME-TO-COMPLETION METRICS
===============================================================================

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ✅

Implemented time-to-completion metrics for the Quote Dashboard, allowing users
to see how long quotes took to complete from start to finish.

===============================================================================
FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
===============================================================================

Feature #80: View time-to-completion metrics for quotes

Test Steps Verified:
✅ Navigate to quote dashboard
✅ Locate completed quote
✅ Verify time from startedAt to completedAt is shown
✅ Verify time is formatted in days/hours

===============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
===============================================================================

Backend (convex/quotes.ts):
- Added completedAt field to getQuotesDashboard return validators
- Included completedAt in query handler response for both PEO and ACA quotes
- Leveraged existing schema (completedAt already in quotes table)

Frontend (components/quotes/quote-dashboard.tsx):
- Created formatTimeToCompletion helper function
- Added "Time to Complete" column to dashboard table
- Displays formatted time for completed quotes (accepted/declined)
- Shows "—" for in-progress quotes

Time Format Examples:
- "7d" - 7 days
- "7d 3h" - 7 days, 3 hours
- "5h" - 5 hours
- "< 1h" - less than 1 hour

===============================================================================
TESTING & VERIFICATION
===============================================================================

Backend Testing:
✅ Created test scripts to verify API responses
✅ Confirmed completedAt included in dashboard query
✅ Verified 2 completed quotes with valid timestamps
✅ Tested time calculation logic with real data

Sample Verified Data:
- Test Client ACA (declined): 7 days to complete
- Quote Test Client PEO (accepted): 7 hours to complete

Code Quality:
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ Type-safe with Convex validators
✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Follows existing patterns
✅ Minimal code changes (38 lines)
