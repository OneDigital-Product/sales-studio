FEATURES COMPLETED: 1 (Feature #164)
PROGRESS: 162/169 → 163/169 tests (95.9% → 96.4%)

FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
-------------------
#164: Breadcrumb Navigation Design (Style Feature)

WHAT WAS BUILT
--------------
Created a professional breadcrumb navigation component that displays the page hierarchy:
- "Sales Studio > [Client Name]" on client detail pages
- Clickable "Sales Studio" link returns to home page
- Current page shown in bold, darker text
- Subtle chevron separators between items
- Smooth hover transitions on clickable links

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------
1. Created new component: components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx
   - BreadcrumbItem interface with label and optional href
   - Semantic HTML: <nav> with <ol>/<li> structure
   - ARIA labels for accessibility
   - ChevronRight icon from lucide-react

2. Integrated into: app/clients/[id]/page.tsx
   - Replaced old "← Back to Dashboard" link
   - Positioned at top of page
   - Dynamically shows client name from data

3. Design specifications:
   - Typography: text-sm (14px)
   - Colors: gray-600 (links), gray-900 (current), gray-400 (separator)
   - Hover: smooth transition from gray-600 to gray-900
   - Spacing: gap-2 between elements, mb-4 bottom margin

TESTING & VERIFICATION
-----------------------
All 6 test steps passed:
✅ Navigate to nested pages
✅ Take screenshots of breadcrumbs
