# Potential Features for Sales Studio

## Goal
Drastically reduce quoting turnaround time by unifying PEO and ACA Plan teams, ensuring they have immediate access to the same client data without re-requests.

## 1. Unified Quote Workspace (The "Single Source of Truth")
Currently, the app has a simple file list. We should upgrade the Client Detail page into a comprehensive **Quote Workspace**.

- **Shared Data Repository**: A structured document center where uploaded files are automatically tagged and available to both PEO and ACA teams.
  - *Feature*: Drag-and-drop zone with auto-categorization (e.g., "Census", "Current Plan Design", "Claims History").
  - *Benefit*: Both teams see the same files instantly. No "did you get the census?" emails.

- **Live Quote Status Dashboard**:
  - *Feature*: Visual status indicators for both PEO and ACA quotes (e.g., `Intake`, `Underwriting`, `Proposal Ready`, `Presented`).
  - *Benefit*: Account Managers can see at a glance if a quote is stuck.

## 2. Intelligent "Smart Census"
The biggest bottleneck is often the employee census.
- **Census Parser & Viewer**:
  - *Feature*: Instead of just storing a CSV, parse it into a searchable, filterable table within the app.
  - *Benefit*: Both teams can validate the data immediately (e.g., check for missing DOBs or Zip Codes) before starting their work.
- **Data Validation**: Automatically flag missing required fields for PEO or ACA quotes upon upload.

## 3. Cross-Team Collaboration Tools
- **Internal Comments & Notes**:
  - *Feature*: Allow PEO and ACA analysts to leave comments on specific files or client records (e.g., "This census is missing participation dates").
  - *Benefit*: Asynchronous communication happens in context, reducing meeting times.
- **"Request Missing Info" Workflow**:
  - *Feature*: A button to trigger a request for specific missing items.
  - *Benefit*: Formalizes the "we are waiting on X" state, stopping the clock on internal SLAs.

## 4. Automated Notifications
- **Real-time Alerts**:
  - *Feature*: Notify the PEO team when the ACA team uploads a file, and vice versa.
  - *Benefit*: Eliminates "dead time" where a file sits unnoticed in a folder.

## 5. Integration & Export
- **Quote Comparison View**:
  - *Feature*: A unified view to display the final PEO vs. ACA numbers side-by-side for the broker/client.
  - *Benefit*: Helps the sales team present a cohesive solution rather than two fragmented options.
