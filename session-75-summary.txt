NOTES
-----
- The assignedTo field already existed in schema, only needed UI and mutation
- Linter auto-formatted code during development
- Feature works independently for PEO and ACA quotes
- Users can clear assignment by leaving field empty
- Clean separation of concerns (backend mutation, frontend UI)
